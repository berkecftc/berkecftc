## 🚀 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student focused on building scalable, maintainable and production-ready full-stack systems.

On the backend, I work primarily with **Spring Boot**, designing RESTful APIs and microservice-based architectures.  
On the frontend, I build modern and responsive interfaces using **React** and related ecosystem tools.

I care about clean architecture, SOLID principles, performance optimization and writing code that scales — not just code that works.

I aim to build systems that are maintainable, extensible and architecturally sound.  
My focus is long-term code quality, not short-term feature delivery.
